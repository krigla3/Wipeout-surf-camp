        <h1>Surf Camp Corralejo</h1>

        <article> 
        <p>With over 300 sunny days per year, the longest sandy beaches on the Canary Islands, a large number of secluded bays and great waves renowned amongst international surfers, you can rest assured that Fuerteventura is one of the best surf spots in Europe!</p>

        <p>Situated on the same geographic latitude as Florida or Mexico, this little volcanic paradise rarely sees temperatures drop below 20°C or rise above 30°C, which provides favourable conditions for surfing year-round. From sandy beaches on the east coast formed by sand brought from the Sahara desert to the hidden villages surrounded by volcanic rocks and black sand beaches on the west coast, Fuerteventura is full of diversity. Our house, an exclusive bungalow decorated in a laidback surfer style is located in the north town of Corralejo, where all the best surf spots are situated. The town itself offers plenty of amenities, perfect for exploring after a long day of surfing such as surf shops, restaurants and bars. The locals are incredibly friendly, and we are happy to offer some recommendations. We look forward to welcoming you! </p>
