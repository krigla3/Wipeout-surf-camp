        <p>Our surf story began in 2013 when we booked a surfing lesson in Corralejo on a whim. After many, hilarious failed attempts we started to get the hang of it, and very quickly fell in love! 
        </p>

        <p>When we returned home to Dublin, we couldn't stop telling friends, family and pretty much anyone who would listen to us about how great our experience was, that it got us thinking - what if we could bring that experience to more people who would enjoy it as much as we did? And so, Wipeout Surf Camps was born, lovingly named after our own wipeouts in our first few lessons! </p>

        <p>Our first camp was held in the early 2014 in Corralejo, which remains our most popular location. By 2017 we had expanded to Maspalomas which also offers amazing surfing and beautiful experiences throughout the island. </p>
    
        <p>It is almost impossible to describe the feeling of riding a wave with just words, and for this reason it is best to experience 
            it for yourselves. The moment when you step on board and stand up on a wave at full speed with ocean foam spraying all around you, you will jump irreversibly into the exciting world of surfing! 
            </p>

        <p>We aim to offer you the best possible surf experience, and for that reason our camps host smaller groups where you will get to know your fellow surfers. We also offer additional activities such as trips across the island, visits to landmarks and lagoons and group nights out if you would like to join us! 
        </p>    

        <p>Most of all, we want you to have an amazing time with us, so get in touch and we'll see you on the waves!!</p>
