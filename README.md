# Wipeout Surf Camps
Read Me file. Live site here.

Wipeout Surf Camps is a site that hopes to open the world of surfing to newcomers, while catering to an existing customer base that has been built over the years. This is the first iteration of the site, with the company relying solely on word of mouth previously. Wipeout Surf Camps will be useful for surfers to gain an understanding of what each location offers, and will provide an option to contact the company or to book directly. For this, the site needs to be easy to navigate, well laid out and as informative as possible.

## Structure 
The site is a simple structure consisting of six individual pages with the following features:

* Navigation bar
    * This is the same on each of the pages and includes links to the Logo, Home, Gallery, Contact Us and Book pages. This allows easy navigation throughout the site without the need for a ‘back’ button. Clicking on the Logo will bring you back to the landing page. You will know you are on this page because the surfer icon will highlight in yellow. 

    ![Navigation](https://github.com/krigla3/Wipeout-surf-camp/blob/master/docs/header.jpg?raw=true)

    * When you navigate to the other pages, then a yellow sun will indicate your location.

    * This functionality is the same across all devices.

* Footer bar
    * The footer is the same on each of the pages and contains a link to each of the social media sites that the company has – Instagram, Facebook and Twitter. The branded logo of each site is in line with the aesthetic of the Wipeout Surf Camps site.

    ![Footer](https://github.com/krigla3/Wipeout-surf-camp/blob/master/docs/footer.jpg?raw=true)

* Landing page
    * The landing page features a call to action, directing you to the two surf house locations. To select a house, when scrolled over/hovered on an image pops up. When clicked, it takes you to the individual information for that location.

    ![Landing-page](https://github.com/krigla3/Wipeout-surf-camp/blob/master/docs/surfhouse-1.png?raw=true)

    * The background image used is that of a surfer in action – a taster of what the user may experience with the company!

* Surf House One   
    * Corralejo. The page contains information on the location, gallery images of the house itself and a Google map showing precise location. Details on accommodation, surfing lessons and prices are also included.

* Surf House Two   
    * Maspalomas. The page contains information on the location, gallery images of the house itself and a Google map showing precise location. Details on accommodation, surfing lessons and prices are also included.

* Gallery
    * The gallery is a collection of images taken from camps held previously. The company offers a photography service, and with the permission of guests uses images from this in the gallery.
    Images are set with a 4px border, while the background is a simple white to prevent clashing. The images are responsive to device size.

* Contact

    * Along with providing direct contact numbers for the founders, this page sets out the history of Wipeout Surf Camps.
      Text is overlaid on a transparent scrim as this allows the text to be read easily over the background image of a wave.

    ![Contact](https://github.com/krigla3/Wipeout-surf-camp/blob/master/docs/contact-us.jpg?raw=true)

* Book

    * A booking form allows users to select which location they are interested in and send a direct inquiry to the customer service team. 
      Entry bars are rounded with a [ ]% border as the curve is more aesthetically pleasing against the background image of a wave being surfed. 
      The ‘Surf’s Up!’ button is highlighted when hovered over, alerting the user to the fact that if they click then their form will be submitted.

    ![Book](https://github.com/krigla3/Wipeout-surf-camp/blob/master/docs/surfs-up-button-yellow.jpg?raw=true)

* Design

    * Colour Scheme: Ocean colour scape – dropper tool from imagery
      Get rgb colours

* Logo 

    * The logo is simple and uses the same font as the header text - Lobster. The client wanted an image of a surf board that would fit with the theme and also wanted to use an open source (free) image. As one could not be found, to address this, a snowboarding image was used which fits quite well given its simplicity.

    ![Logo-plain](https://github.com/krigla3/Wipeout-surf-camp/blob/master/docs/logo-plain.jpg?raw=true)

    ![Logo-yellow](https://github.com/krigla3/Wipeout-surf-camp/blob/master/docs/logo-yellow.jpg?raw=true)

* Typography
    * Headings: Lobster, san serif as backup.
    * Body: Raleway

* Responsiveness

    * Responsiveness is good across screen size and devices. 

* Features left to implement

    * A discussion was had on whether or not to embed video clips in the gallery and to add audio to the landing page. On reflection, the client decided to wait until they had time to edit some new footage, but are keen to revisit the idea. 
    A chat option was also considered, but given the timeline for completion, the client also decided to wait.
    By implementing both ideas at a later date, it will give users a fresh experience and allow the client to promote the changes across their social media.

## Features

### Existing features

* Navigation Bar 
    * Includes direct links to the Home, Walking Tips, Gallery, and Contacts Us pages, allowing the user to easily navigate between them. 

    ![Navigation](https://github.com/OlgaJ1989/sussex-walks/blob/master/docs/navigation.png)

* Landing page image with overlaying page title
    * The home.html page (Home) includes a picture of the countryside, with the title of the wesbsite, Sussex Walks, added as overlaying text. The title acts as a centerpiece of the image and catches the eye instantly.

    ![Title](https://github.com/OlgaJ1989/sussex-walks/blob/master/docs/title.png)

* Intro
    * A small section explaining the purpose of the website and the type of walks people can find in Sussex. 

    ![Intro](https://github.com/OlgaJ1989/sussex-walks/blob/master/docs/intro.png)

* Popular Walks section
    * A section describing four chosen walks with images from along the routes and embedded Google maps for each. The images clearly showcase the landmarks walkers can expect to see and the clickable maps provide the exact route. The design is responsive - users will see 4 columns next to each other on bigger screens and 1 column at a time on smaller devices.

    ![Walks](https://github.com/OlgaJ1989/sussex-walks/blob/master/docs/walks.png)

* Interactive footer across all pages
    * It consists of clickable icons linking the user to a choice of social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Twitter). All links open in new tabs so the user does not have to leave the Sussex Walks page.

    ![Footer](https://github.com/OlgaJ1989/sussex-walks/blob/master/docs/footer.png)

* Gallery
    * The Gallery located in gallery.html will provide the user with a collection of photographs showcasing landmarks they will be able to see during their walks. Responsive design of the gallery means the images will still be viewed in a good reolution on a smaller screen.

    ![Gallery](https://github.com/OlgaJ1989/sussex-walks/blob/master/docs/gallery.png)  

* Contact Us form
    * The contact.html page consists of a form which users can use in order to contact the admin with any questions / queries. 
    
    ![Form](https://github.com/OlgaJ1989/sussex-walks/blob/master/docs/form.png)

* A favicon
    * A favicon has been added to make it easier for users to find the Sussex Walks page if multiple tabs are open. 
    
    ![Favicon](https://github.com/OlgaJ1989/sussex-walks/blob/master/docs/favicon.png)

### Features left to implement

I would like to include another page consisting of a form and called Design Your Walk or similar. The form would consist of a short survey, covering areas such as difficulty, length, and type of a walk. Radio buttons and checkboxes would be provided for the user to be able to make their choices, which they could then submit to the admin to receive personalised walk ideas tailored to their choices.

### Validator testing

* HTML - when the code was passed through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html) I have received the following error notification: "Element h3 not allowed as child of element label in this context." referring to all input labels in the Contact Us form. To fix this, I have changed all h3 elements to span elements as per the advice found in [this Stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50068995/element-h3-not-allowed-as-child-of-element-label-in-this-context-html). No further errors have been found after I applied this fix and passed the code through the validator again.
* CSS - no errors were found when code was passed through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fnu%2F%3Fdoc%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcode-institute-org.github.io%252Flove-running-2.0%252Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en#css)
* Accessibility - when using the [Wave Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool](https://wave.webaim.org) to test the site's accessibility, I received 2 errors:
    * There was not enough contrast between the background and font of the 'Submit' button in the Contact Us form. I have corrected this by changing the background color #559e79 to #32644b. No further errors have been found after I applied this fix and passed the site through the validator again.
    * Two of the aria-labels in the Gallery page were identical. I have corrected this by changing the name of one of them. No further errors have been found after I applied thise fix and passed the site through the validator again.
